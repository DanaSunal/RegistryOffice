Ultimate goal of this service is to perform software version or instance upgrade without(or with minimum) downtime. This service will be initiated by a new application to the old(or same) version of the same application. The functionality within this service performs a set of procedure to transfer the data from old application to new application using callbacks.

Every new version will be backward compatible with its immediate previous version for a smooth integration with multiple MS. So, software version upgrades should be sequential in order to have a backward compatible version.

unlike others , this service is not a straightforward one. It has to perform a number of callbacks to transfer the data from old to new version.

To perform upgrade(or instance change) , old and new version of the Registry office will proceed as mentioned below (in a high level),

The callbacks will be executed in the waterfall model. And if one callback fails, then rest of the callbacks will not be performed further.

## Configuration:

When the old version receives the request , to further communicate with the proper application instance of the new version , 
the remote address and port of the "newRelease" will be noted by the old version and so the new release number.
So in the load file of the old release , the http-client-interface and tcp-client-interface will be edited.

## Forwardings:

After successful configuration of the layer protocols, parallel notifications will be triggered for the following forwarding-constructs that corresponds to the update happed in the load file ,
- ServiceRequestCausesLtpUpdateRequestALT : If there is a modification to the logical-termination-point , then the details about that LTP will be updated to the Application Layer Topology application.
- ServiceRequestCausesLoggingRequestEaTL : The service request will be recorded to the Execution and Trace log application.

Apart from the above forwardings , the following callbacks will be initiated to perform the upgrade. Each callback is intended to transfer the existing data from the old release to new release.

**PromptForBequeathingDataCausesNewApplicationBeingRequestedToInquireForApplicationTypeApprovals :**

To make the new application aware about the current TypeApproval Application , this forwarding initiated the v1/inquire-application-type-approval request to the new version and transfers the application information and transport details. 
 > Old application identifies the correct instance by using the "RegistrationCausesInquiryForApplicationTypeApproval" forwardingName

**PromptForBequeathingDataCausesNewApplicationBeingRequestedToDocumentSubscriptionsForDeregistrationNotifications :**

This forwarding is to transfer the information about the applications subscribed for deregistration notification. 
> The subscribed application information will be identified by the "DeregistrationNotification" forwardingName.

**PromptForBequeathingDataCausesNewApplicationBeingRequestedToDocumentSubscriptionsForApprovalNotifications:**

This forwarding is to transfer the information about the applications subscribed for approval notification. 
> The subscribed application information will be identified by the "ApprovalNotification" forwardingName.

**PromptForBequeathingDataCausesNewApplicationBeingRequestedToDocumentSubscriptionsForWithdrawnApprovalNotifications**

This forwarding is to transfer the information about the applications subscribed for withdrawn approval notification. 
> The subscribed application information will be identified by the "WithdrawnApprovalNotification" forwardingName.

**PromptForBequeathingDataCausesTransferOfListOfAlreadyRegisteredApplications :**

This forwarding is to transfer the information about the registered applications. Apart from the &quot;old&quot; and &quot;new&quot; release , all the other application information will be transferred as a part of this callback.

**PromptForBequeathingDataCausesTARbeingRequestedToRedirectInfoAboutApprovalsToNewApplication :**

This forwarding will initiate a request to the &quot;TypeApprovalRegistry&quot; application to redirect the application &quot;approval status change&quot; to the new version.

**PromptForBequeathingDataCausesRequestForBroadcastingInfoAboutServerReplacement:**

This forwarding will initiate a request to the &quot;old Registry office&quot;(that is, to its own) application to broadcast about the new release to all the approved application in the SDN MS environment.

![](./images/BequeathYourDataAndDie/Picture11.JPG)

**PromptForBequeathingDataCausesRequestForDeregisteringOfOldRelease :**

At this point of time , the old registry office might have transferred all its data to the new application. 
And now , the new application is the active registry office.

This forwarding will deregister the old Registry Office from the SDN MS environment.
